# cacheSignal

### React Server Components

`cacheSignal` is currently only used with [React Server Components](/blog/2023/03/22/react-labs-what-we-have-been-working-on-march-2023#react-server-components).

`cacheSignal` allows you to know when the `cache()` lifetime is over.
[code]
    const signal = cacheSignal();
[/code]

  * Reference 
    * `cacheSignal`
  * Usage 
    * Cancel in-flight requests 
    * Ignore errors after React has finished rendering 



* * *

## Reference 

### `cacheSignal`

Call `cacheSignal` to get an `AbortSignal`.
[code] 
    import {cacheSignal} from 'react';  
    
    
    async function Component() {  
    
    
      await fetch(url, { signal: cacheSignal() });  
    
    
    }
[/code]

When React has finished rendering, the `AbortSignal` will be aborted. This allows you to cancel any in-flight work that is no longer needed. Rendering is considered finished when:

  * React has successfully completed rendering
  * the render was aborted
  * the render has failed



#### Parameters 

This function does not accept any parameters.

#### Returns 

`cacheSignal` returns an `AbortSignal` if called during rendering. Otherwise `cacheSignal()` returns `null`.

#### Caveats 

  * `cacheSignal` is currently for use in [React Server Components](/reference/rsc/server-components) only. In Client Components, it will always return `null`. In the future it will also be used for Client Component when a client cache refreshes or invalidates. You should not assume it’ll always be null on the client.
  * If called outside of rendering, `cacheSignal` will return `null` to make it clear that the current scope isn’t cached forever.

## Usage 

### Cancel in-flight requests 

Call `cacheSignal` to abort in-flight requests.
[code] 
    import {cache, cacheSignal} from 'react';  
    
    
    const dedupedFetch = cache(fetch);  
    
    
    async function Component() {  
    
    
      await dedupedFetch(url, { signal: cacheSignal() });  
    
    
    }
[/code]

### Pitfall

You can’t use `cacheSignal` to abort async work that was started outside of rendering e.g.
[code]
    import {cacheSignal} from 'react';  
    
    
    // 🚩 Pitfall: The request will not actually be aborted if the rendering of `Component` is finished.  
    
    
    const response = fetch(url, { signal: cacheSignal() });  
    
    
    async function Component() {  
    
    
      await response;  
    
    
    }
[/code]

### Ignore errors after React has finished rendering 

If a function throws, it may be due to cancellation (e.g. the Database connection has been closed). You can use the `aborted` property to check if the error was due to cancellation or a real error. You may want to ignore errors that were due to cancellation.
[code] 
    import {cacheSignal} from "react";  
    
    
    import {queryDatabase, logError} from "./database";  
    
    
      
    
    
    async function getData(id) {  
    
    
      try {  
    
    
         return await queryDatabase(id);  
    
    
      } catch (x) {  
    
    
         if (!cacheSignal()?.aborted) {  
    
    
            // only log if it's a real error and not due to cancellation  
    
    
           logError(x);  
    
    
         }  
    
    
         return null;  
    
    
      }  
    
    
    }  
    
    
      
    
    
    async function Component({id}) {  
    
    
      const data = await getData(id);  
    
    
      if (data === null) {  
    
    
        return <div>No data available</div>;  
    
    
      }  
    
    
      return <div>{data.name}</div>;  
    
    
    }
[/code]
