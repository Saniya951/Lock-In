# refs

Validates correct usage of refs, not reading/writing during render. See the “pitfalls” section in [`useRef()` usage](/reference/react/useRef#usage).

## Rule Details 

Refs hold values that aren’t used for rendering. Unlike state, changing a ref doesn’t trigger a re-render. Reading or writing `ref.current` during render breaks React’s expectations. Refs might not be initialized when you try to read them, and their values can be stale or inconsistent.

## How It Detects Refs 

The lint only applies these rules to values it knows are refs. A value is inferred as a ref when the compiler sees any of the following patterns:

  * Returned from `useRef()` or `React.createRef()`.
[code] const scrollRef = useRef(null);
[/code]

  * An identifier named `ref` or ending in `Ref` that reads from or writes to `.current`.
[code] buttonRef.current = node;
[/code]

  * Passed through a JSX `ref` prop (for example `<div ref={someRef} />`).
[code] <input ref={inputRef} />
[/code]




Once something is marked as a ref, that inference follows the value through assignments, destructuring, or helper calls. This lets the lint surface violations even when `ref.current` is accessed inside another function that received the ref as an argument.

## Common Violations 

  * Reading `ref.current` during render
  * Updating `refs` during render
  * Using `refs` for values that should be state



### Invalid 

Examples of incorrect code for this rule:
[code] 
    // ❌ Reading ref during render  
    
    
    function Component() {  
    
    
      const ref = useRef(0);  
    
    
      const value = ref.current; // Don't read during render  
    
    
      return <div>{value}</div>;  
    
    
    }  
    
    
      
    
    
    // ❌ Modifying ref during render  
    
    
    function Component({value}) {  
    
    
      const ref = useRef(null);  
    
    
      ref.current = value; // Don't modify during render  
    
    
      return <div />;  
    
    
    }
[/code]

### Valid 

Examples of correct code for this rule:
[code] 
    // ✅ Read ref in effects/handlers  
    
    
    function Component() {  
    
    
      const ref = useRef(null);  
    
    
      
    
    
      useEffect(() => {  
    
    
        if (ref.current) {  
    
    
          console.log(ref.current.offsetWidth); // OK in effect  
    
    
        }  
    
    
      });  
    
    
      
    
    
      return <div ref={ref} />;  
    
    
    }  
    
    
      
    
    
    // ✅ Use state for UI values  
    
    
    function Component() {  
    
    
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);  
    
    
      
    
    
      return (  
    
    
        <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>  
    
    
          {count}  
    
    
        </button>  
    
    
      );  
    
    
    }  
    
    
      
    
    
    // ✅ Lazy initialization of ref value  
    
    
    function Component() {  
    
    
      const ref = useRef(null);  
    
    
      
    
    
      // Initialize only once on first use  
    
    
      if (ref.current === null) {  
    
    
        ref.current = expensiveComputation(); // OK - lazy initialization  
    
    
      }  
    
    
      
    
    
      const handleClick = () => {  
    
    
        console.log(ref.current); // Use the initialized value  
    
    
      };  
    
    
      
    
    
      return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click</button>;  
    
    
    }
[/code]

## Troubleshooting 

### The lint flagged my plain object with `.current`

The name heuristic intentionally treats `ref.current` and `fooRef.current` as real refs. If you’re modeling a custom container object, pick a different name (for example, `box`) or move the mutable value into state. Renaming avoids the lint because the compiler stops inferring it as a ref.
