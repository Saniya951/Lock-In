Define data model:\n   - const STORAGE_KEY = 'simple_todo_tasks';\n   - let tasks = [];\n   - function loadTasks() reads JSON from localStorage, parses, assigns to tasks.\n   - function saveTasks() writes JSON.stringify(tasks) to localStorage.\n2. Define UI rendering functions:\n   - function renderTasks(filter = 'all') clears #task-list and creates <li> for each task matching filter.\n   - Each <li> includes a checkbox input (class='toggle'), span for text, and button class='delete-btn'.\n   - Apply .completed class when task.completed is true.\n3. Define event handlers:\n   - addTask(event): reads #new-task value, creates task object {id: Date.now(), text, completed:false}, pushes to tasks, saves, re-renders with current filter.\n   - toggleTask(id): flips completed flag, saves, re-renders.\n   - deleteTask(id): removes from tasks array, saves, re-renders.\n   - setFilter(event): updates active filter button, re-renders.\n4. Wire up DOMContentLoaded:\n   - Call loadTasks(); set currentFilter='all'; renderTasks();\n   - Attach listeners: #add-btn click -> addTask, #new-task keypress Enter -> addTask, delegation on #task-list for change on .toggle and click on .delete-btn, click on .filter-btn -> setFilter.\n5. Export (if using modules) not required; script runs in browser.\nAll functions and variables are defined in this file and referenced by index.html via script tag. Ensure function signatures match event listener expectations (event parameter)."
