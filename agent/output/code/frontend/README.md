# Frontend (React)

This directory contains the React single‑page application for the portfolio.

If the project was generated with **create‑react‑app**, you should see the standard `src/`, `public/`, and configuration files.

### Initialising the React app
If the scaffold is not yet present, run one of the following commands from this directory:

```bash
# Using Create React App (CRA)
npx create-react-app .

# Or using Vite (lighter and faster)
npm create vite@latest . -- --template react
```

After the scaffold is created, install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm start   # or `npm run dev` for Vite
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (CRA) or `http://localhost:5173` (Vite).
