    "project_goal": "Create a responsive portfolio website for a UI/UX designer using Flask, React, and MongoDB.",
    "steps": [
        "Initialize a Git repository and set up the project structure with separate folders for the Flask backend and React frontend.",
        "Configure MongoDB and design the schema for collections such as 'projects' (title, description, images, tools, case study), 'testimonials', and 'messages' (contact form submissions).",
        "Set up the Flask backend: create the app, configure CORS, connect to MongoDB, and implement RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on projects, fetching testimonials, and handling contact form submissions.",
        "Implement authentication (optional) for the designer to manage portfolio content via a simple admin panel.",
        "Create the React frontend using Create React App or Vite: set up routing with React Router for pages like Home, About, Portfolio Gallery, Project Detail, Testimonials, and Contact.",
        "Design and develop reusable UI components (Header, Footer, Card, Modal, Image Carousel) with a focus on clean UI/UX, using CSS-in-JS or a styling framework (e.g., Tailwind CSS).",
        "Build the Portfolio Gallery page to fetch and display project cards from the Flask API; implement filtering by category or tool.",
        "Develop the Project Detail page to show an in-depth case study with images, process steps, and outcomes, pulling data from the backend.",
        "Create a Contact page with a form that posts messages to the Flask API and displays success/error feedback.",
        "Integrate testimonials section by fetching data from the API and presenting it in a carousel component.",
        "Implement responsive design and accessibility best practices across all components.",
        "Test the full stack: verify API endpoints, frontend data fetching, form submissions, and UI responsiveness.",
        "Set up environment variables, Dockerize the application (optional), and deploy the backend (e.g., Render, Heroku) and frontend (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).",
        "Document the project setup, usage instructions, and provide a README with screenshots of the UI/UX design."
