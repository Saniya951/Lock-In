## Reference 

### `captureOwnerStack()`

Call `captureOwnerStack` to get the current Owner Stack.
[code] 
    import * as React from 'react';  
    
    
      
    
    
    function Component() {  
    
    
      if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {  
    
    
        const ownerStack = React.captureOwnerStack();  
    
    
        console.log(ownerStack);  
    
    
      }  
    
    
    }
[/code]

#### Parameters 

`captureOwnerStack` does not take any parameters.

#### Returns 

`captureOwnerStack` returns `string | null`.

Owner Stacks are available in

  * Component render
  * Effects (e.g. `useEffect`)
  * React’s event handlers (e.g. `<button onClick={...} />`)
  * React error handlers ([React Root options](/reference/react-dom/client/createRoot#parameters) `onCaughtError`, `onRecoverableError`, and `onUncaughtError`)



If no Owner Stack is available, `null` is returned (see Troubleshooting: The Owner Stack is `null`).

#### Caveats 

  * Owner Stacks are only available in development. `captureOwnerStack` will always return `null` outside of development.



##### Deep Dive

#### Owner Stack vs Component Stack 

Show Details

The Owner Stack is different from the Component Stack available in React error handlers like [`errorInfo.componentStack` in `onUncaughtError`](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot#error-logging-in-production).

For example, consider the following code:

index.jsApp.js

index.js

ReloadClear[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")
[code]
    import {captureOwnerStack} from 'react';
    import {createRoot} from 'react-dom/client';
    import App, {Component} from './App.js';
    import './styles.css';
    
    createRoot(document.createElement('div'), {
      onUncaughtError: (error, errorInfo) => {
        // The stacks are logged instead of showing them in the UI directly to
        // highlight that browsers will apply sourcemaps to the logged stacks.
        // Note that sourcemapping is only applied in the real browser console not
        // in the fake one displayed on this page.
        // Press "fork" to be able to view the sourcemapped stack in a real console.
        console.log(errorInfo.componentStack);
        console.log(captureOwnerStack());
      },
    }).render(
      <App>
        <Component label="disabled" />
      </App>
    );
    
    
[/code]

`SubComponent` would throw an error. The Component Stack of that error would be
[code]
    at SubComponent  
    
    
    at fieldset  
    
    
    at Component  
    
    
    at main  
    
    
    at React.Suspense  
    
    
    at App
[/code]

However, the Owner Stack would only read
[code]
    at Component
[/code]

Neither `App` nor the DOM components (e.g. `fieldset`) are considered Owners in this Stack since they didn’t contribute to “creating” the node containing `SubComponent`. `App` and DOM components only forwarded the node. `App` just rendered the `children` node as opposed to `Component` which created a node containing `SubComponent` via `<SubComponent />`.

Neither `Navigation` nor `legend` are in the stack at all since it’s only a sibling to a node containing `<SubComponent />`.

`SubComponent` is omitted because it’s already part of the callstack.

## Usage 

### Enhance a custom error overlay 
[code] 
    import { captureOwnerStack } from "react";  
    
    
    import { instrumentedConsoleError } from "./errorOverlay";  
    
    
      
    
    
    const originalConsoleError = console.error;  
    
    
    console.error = function patchedConsoleError(...args) {  
    
    
      originalConsoleError.apply(console, args);  
    
    
      const ownerStack = captureOwnerStack();  
    
    
      onConsoleError({  
    
    
        // Keep in mind that in a real application, console.error can be  
    
    
        // called with multiple arguments which you should account for.  
    
    
        consoleMessage: args[0],  
    
    
        ownerStack,  
    
    
      });  
    
    
    };
[/code]

If you intercept `console.error` calls to highlight them in an error overlay, you can call `captureOwnerStack` to include the Owner Stack.

[code]
    import { captureOwnerStack } from "react";
    import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
    import App from './App';
    import { onConsoleError } from "./errorOverlay";
    import './styles.css';
    
    const originalConsoleError = console.error;
    console.error = function patchedConsoleError(...args) {
      originalConsoleError.apply(console, args);
      const ownerStack = captureOwnerStack();
      onConsoleError({
        // Keep in mind that in a real application, console.error can be
        // called with multiple arguments which you should account for.
        consoleMessage: args[0],
        ownerStack,
      });
    };
    
    const container = document.getElementById("root");
    createRoot(container).render(<App />);
    
    
[/code]

## Troubleshooting 

### The Owner Stack is `null`

The call of `captureOwnerStack` happened outside of a React controlled function e.g. in a `setTimeout` callback, after a `fetch` call or in a custom DOM event handler. During render, Effects, React event handlers, and React error handlers (e.g. `hydrateRoot#options.onCaughtError`) Owner Stacks should be available.

In the example below, clicking the button will log an empty Owner Stack because `captureOwnerStack` was called during a custom DOM event handler. The Owner Stack must be captured earlier e.g. by moving the call of `captureOwnerStack` into the Effect body.

App.js

App.js

ReloadClear[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")
[code]
    import {captureOwnerStack, useEffect} from 'react';
    
    export default function App() {
      useEffect(() => {
        // Should call `captureOwnerStack` here.
        function handleEvent() {
          // Calling it in a custom DOM event handler is too late.
          // The Owner Stack will be `null` at this point.
          console.log('Owner Stack: ', captureOwnerStack());
        }
    
        document.addEventListener('click', handleEvent);
    
        return () => {
          document.removeEventListener('click', handleEvent);
        }
      })
    
      return <button>Click me to see that Owner Stacks are not available in custom DOM event handlers</button>;
    }
    
    
[/code]

### `captureOwnerStack` is not available 

`captureOwnerStack` is only exported in development builds. It will be `undefined` in production builds. If `captureOwnerStack` is used in files that are bundled for production and development, you should conditionally access it from a namespace import.
[code] 
    // Don't use named imports of `captureOwnerStack` in files that are bundled for development and production.  
    
    
    import {captureOwnerStack} from 'react';  
    
    
    // Use a namespace import instead and access `captureOwnerStack` conditionally.  
    
    
    import * as React from 'react';  
    
    
      
    
    
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {  
    
    
      const ownerStack = React.captureOwnerStack();  
    
    
      console.log('Owner Stack', ownerStack);  
    
    
    }
[/code]
