# Built-in React DOM Hooks

The `react-dom` package contains Hooks that are only supported for web applications (which run in the browser DOM environment). These Hooks are not supported in non-browser environments like iOS, Android, or Windows applications. If you are looking for Hooks that are supported in web browsers _and other environments_ see [the React Hooks page](/reference/react/hooks). This page lists all the Hooks in the `react-dom` package.

## Form Hooks 

_Forms_ let you create interactive controls for submitting information. To manage forms in your components, use one of these Hooks:

  * [`useFormStatus`](/reference/react-dom/hooks/useFormStatus) allows you to make updates to the UI based on the status of a form.


[code] 
    function Form({ action }) {  
    
    
      async function increment(n) {  
    
    
        return n + 1;  
    
    
      }  
    
    
      const [count, incrementFormAction] = useActionState(increment, 0);  
    
    
      return (  
    
    
        <form action={action}>  
    
    
          <button formAction={incrementFormAction}>Count: {count}</button>  
    
    
          <Button />  
    
    
        </form>  
    
    
      );  
    
    
    }  
    
    
      
    
    
    function Button() {  
    
    
      const { pending } = useFormStatus();  
    
    
      return (  
    
    
        <button disabled={pending} type="submit">  
    
    
          Submit  
    
    
        </button>  
    
    
      );  
    
    
    }
